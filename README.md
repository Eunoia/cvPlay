Tree Phonograph
---------------

Listen to the tree's speak their song with the [Tree Phonograph!](http://eunoia.github.io/cvPlay/).
It's a tree ring rotated with HTML5 canvas. Simple code reads a 20x20 patch
of tree, and plays pleasing tones.

Reason d'etre
-------------
cvPlay shows my experimentation as I learn enough openCV to impliment a distance finder.
The best example of this is Mssrs. Tuohy, Cualain, Jones, and Glavin paper, ["Distance Determination for an Automobile Environment using Inverse Perspective Mapping in OpenCV"](http://shanetuohy.com/fyp/Images/issc.pdf)
Experiments in computer vision.

Building
--------
cvPlay required openCV. Installing openCV is easy with Homebrew
```
	brew install opencv
	cmake .
	make
```
